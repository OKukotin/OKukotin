### Hello there 👋

I'm an amateur Java developer who enjoys creating clean and efficient code. I'm passionate about constantly improving my skills and learning new technologies. I wish to become a world-level software development specialist.

Outside of coding, I'm a big fan of anime and manga. I also enjoy listening to music, particularly rock, punk, and a bit of pop. When it comes to books, I love diving into fantasy worlds like LotR, Terry Pratchett's works, and the Witcher series. I'm also drawn to science fiction, with favourites including Dune and Foundation. In addition, I have a keen interest in spiritual and psychological development, exploring works by authors like Kastaneda, Joe Dispenza, and Eric Bern.

🔭 Graduate student in the 13th season of the GeekHub Java for Web course.

👨‍💻 Tech stack: Java 17+, Spring Framework, Spring Security, Docker, PostgreSQL.
