### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an amateur Java developer who enjoys creating clean and efficient code. I'm passionate about constantly improving my skills and learning new technologies. I wish to become a world-level professional in my tech stack. Interested in videogames and hacking.

ðŸŒ± Now Iâ€™m learning Spring Boot and microservices.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on JOwl project, a crawling application based on Java 17, Spring Boot, Gradle, Lucene and some other technologies.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source Java projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, software design patterns, or clean code.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Just try to work with me on my projects!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: I can be called "The Boy Who Lived"
